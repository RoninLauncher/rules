# Rules
## Basic rules
1. Everything is written in english. Variable names, class names, unit names, documentation as well as issues, projects, etc...
2. New changes never gonna get pushed to `main`. Instead they need to be suggested through a Pull Request.

## Group specific rules
1. Atleast one commit every 45 minuntes will be made.
2. As many time as possible will be put in the actual coding. Only timeto discuss things directly will be wednesday for 15 minutes at the begin of the lesson.
3. Everything that needs to be discussed will be discussed on GitHub through issues and other tools.

## Style
1. As a style reference the following sources are provided:
    - [FPC coding style](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Coding_style)
    - [Lazarus design guidelines](https://wiki.freepascal.org/DesignGuidelines)
2. If some things differ that is because this project uses `JCF` to format the units. The standard config file for the tool can be found in this repository. In case of doubt, the style of the formatter is preferable.
